## Ocean Health Index: CW Nutrient Plumes 

This data layer is prepped within the pourpoints_PO4eq_prep and the /plumes folder. 

1. Create a pourpoint file, which is done in the first half of the data prep `pourpoints_PO4eq_prep.Rmd`. 
2. Use the prepped pourpoint file to feed into the plume model. The steps to run the plume model are outlined in the README in the /plumes folder. 
3. Explore the output of the plume model in `plume_output_exploration.Rmd`
