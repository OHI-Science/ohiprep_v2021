## Methods

 - Apply a global health value to all regions. 
 
 Taken from [Waycott et al. 2009](https://www.pnas.org/content/106/30/12377):
  - Our comprehensive global assessment of 215 studies found that seagrasses have been disappearing at a rate of 110 km2 yrâˆ’1 since 1980 and that 29% of the known areal extent has disappeared since seagrass areas were initially recorded in 1879.
  
Based on this, we will score all regions health as 1 - 0.29 = 0.71. 


"This reflects global loss since 1879; however, most of the loss is expected to have occurred since 1990.  There is likely to be much spatial variation that isn't accounted for by using a global value, but we are limited by the availability of data."


```{r}
seagrass_extent <- read_csv("data/habitat_extent_seagrass_updated.csv")  ## read in extent data

## give all regions a health score of 0.71

seagrass_health <- seagrass_extent %>%
  dplyr::select(-km2) %>%
  mutate(health = 0.71) %>%
  mutate(year = 2021)

write.csv(seagrass_health, "data/habitat_health_seagrass_updated.csv", row.names = FALSE)

seagrass_health_gf <- seagrass_health %>%
  mutate(gap_fill = "global value") %>%
  dplyr::select(-health)

write.csv(seagrass_health_gf, "data/health_seagrass_gf.csv", row.names = FALSE)

```

```{r}

seagrass_health <- read_csv("data/habitat_health_seagrass_updated.csv")

old_seagrass_health <- read_csv(file.path(here(), "globalprep/hab_seagrass/v2012/data/habitat_health_seagrass_updated.csv"))

compare_habitat_health <- seagrass_health %>%
  left_join(old_seagrass_health, by = "rgn_id") %>%
  # mutate(km2.y = ifelse(
  #   km2.x >0 & is.na(km2.y) ,0, #assign 0 values to old data km2 that have new data so that we can properly graph these differences.
  #   km2.y
  # )) %>%
  mutate(difference = health.x - health.y) %>%
  left_join(rgns_eez)
```
